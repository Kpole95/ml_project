## üìä ML Pipeline Overview

The training process is broken down into three main stages:

1.  **Data Ingestion**: Reads the raw data, splits it into training and testing sets, and saves them in the `/artifacts` folder.
2.  **Data Transformation**: Applies preprocessing to the data, such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and one-hot encoding categorical features. It saves the preprocessor object as a pickle file.
3.  **Model Training**: Trains multiple regression models on the preprocessed data, uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters, and saves the best-performing model as a pickle file.
